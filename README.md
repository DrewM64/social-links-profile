## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was very similar to the last one, so I didn't really do anything new. I experimented a little bit with Flexbox for the spacing on the `<a>` elements, using the `gap` prpperty just because it felt a bit more streamlined compared to setting a margin-bottom on all but the last link.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Grid layout guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) 
- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox layout guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)anyone still learning this concept.

Once again, the layout guides provided by CSS-Tricks are a very useful and easy guide for understanding and using Grid and Flexbox. I can't recommend them enough.
